# Todo Manager - To manage all your daily task.

Things I used:

### Framer-Motion

via this we added all the animation effect and the motion to the component/todo-containers. 

### react-icons

this is used in the styling part.

## Repo structure

In this repo there is src which has component- where all the React components/ele used in this project are.

There is also contexts folder in src which contains the context for the project defining all the functions needed and the poperties of the todos.
